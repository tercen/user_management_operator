# User Management Tests Documentation

This document explains the widget tests implemented for the User Management application.

## Test Overview

The test suite validates all core functionality of the user management system, including user search, creation, validation, and data display.

## Test Cases

### 1. App Displays User Management Title
**File:** `test/widget_test.dart:7`

**Purpose:** Verifies that the application displays the correct title in the app bar.

**What it tests:**
- The app bar contains the text "User Management"

**Why it matters:** Ensures basic app structure and branding are correct.

---

### 2. Search for User Filters the List
**File:** `test/widget_test.dart:13`

**Purpose:** Tests the real-time search functionality that filters users by name or email.

**What it tests:**
- Initially, all three users (John Doe, Jane Smith, Bob Johnson) are displayed
- When "John" is entered in the search field, only John Doe remains visible
- Jane Smith is filtered out from the visible list

**Why it matters:** Search is a critical feature for managing large user lists. This ensures the filtering logic works correctly.

### 3. Add User Opens Dialog
**File:** `test/widget_test.dart:28`

**Purpose:** Verifies that clicking the add button opens the user creation dialog.

**What it tests:**
- Tapping the floating action button (+ icon) opens a dialog
- The dialog shows "Add User" as the title
- The dialog contains Name and Email input fields

**Why it matters:** Confirms the UI for adding users is accessible and properly structured.

### 4. Add User With Valid Data
**File:** `test/widget_test.dart:39`

**Purpose:** Tests the complete flow of adding a new user with valid information.

**What it tests:**
- Opens the add user dialog
- Fills in name field with "Test User"
- Fills in email field with "test@example.com"
- Saves the form
- Verifies the new user appears in the list

**Why it matters:** This is the happy path for user creation - the most common and important use case.

---

### 5. Add User Validation Requires Name
**File:** `test/widget_test.dart:55`

**Purpose:** Tests form validation when the name field is empty.

**What it tests:**
- Opens the add user dialog
- Fills in only the email field
- Attempts to save without a name
- Verifies the error message "Please enter a name" is displayed

**Why it matters:** Ensures data integrity by preventing users from being created without required information.

---

### 6. Add User Validation Requires Valid Email
**File:** `test/widget_test.dart:69`

**Purpose:** Tests email format validation.

**What it tests:**
- Opens the add user dialog
- Fills in name field with "Test User"
- Fills in email field with "invalid-email" (missing @ symbol)
- Attempts to save with invalid email
- Verifies the error message "Please enter a valid email" is displayed

**Why it matters:** Ensures email addresses are properly formatted, which is critical for communication and data quality.

---

### 7. View User Details Shows Dialog
**File:** `test/widget_test.dart:84`

**Purpose:** Verifies that the initial user list is properly populated.

**What it tests:**
- All three default users are displayed:
  - John Doe
  - Jane Smith
  - Bob Johnson (disabled by default)

**Why it matters:** Ensures the application starts with the correct sample data and all users are properly rendered.
